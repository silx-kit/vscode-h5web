    domain no longer reduces the slider's extent (and therefore keeps the thumbs
    where you drop them)
  - Select-to-zoom interactions now zoom only on areas of at least 20x20px,
    which avoids inadvertently zooming on very small areas
  - Fix error when switching from "NX Heatmap" to "NX Line" visualization with
    an axis dataset longer than the signal dataset by one value (i.e. pixel
    boundaries)
  - For the full list of changes, please refer to the release notes for
