# Changelog

## [v0.1.5](https://github.com/silx-kit/vscode-h5web/compare/v0.1.4...v0.1.5)

- ‚ú® **Allow opening HDF5 files of any size.** Previously, when you tried to
  open a file larger than 2 GB, you would see an error in the H5Web webview
  editor. Now, you will be able to browse for the file manually from inside the
  webview, and doing so will bypass the file size limitation.
